#HOW TO USE
First open the file `test-reflect_refract.py` and find the lines indicating where various objects representing curves are appended to the list initialObjs. The user may add, remove, or modify these curves as they like so long as they use valid objects found in `reflect_refract.py` (with the exception of Object as this class is not meant for usage and will fail). Once all the objects are added into the list, the user can run the following in the terminal.

```bash
python3 test-reflect_refract.py
```
